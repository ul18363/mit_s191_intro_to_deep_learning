#To be able to use GPU's Pytorch Torchvision and CUDA need to be installed 
(cudatoolkit seems to be a dependency of pytorch so installing pytorch already 
bring it in) and should be compatible with each other

conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch

# Pytorch:
Pytorch is a  machine learning library developed by Facebooks AI Research lab 
(FAIR).

Try this to see if GPU is available:
import tensorflow as tf
tf.config.list_physical_devices()

or

from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib
local_device_protos = device_lib.list_local_devices()
local_device_protos

conda install tensorflow=2.1
Tensorflow should be build with CUDA 10.1 and cuDNN 7.6
nvcc -V # If nvcc is not recognized use sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit


# 1. Cause 1: CuDNN build installed in Anaconda doesn’t support.
conda install cudnn=7.6.5=cuda10.1_0

# 2. Cause 2: tensorflow’s build is bad.
In Anaconda, there are three types of tensorflow’s builds: eigen, gpu, and mkl.
I tried to install another build.

conda install tensorflow=2.1.0=gpu_py37h7db9008_0
